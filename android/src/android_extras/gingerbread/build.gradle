  Gradle's maven plugin doesn't respect full artifact names yet, so
  when another repo downloads this aar, it will have a conflict if the
  basename is also gingerbread.aar. If this happens, switch the basename
  here until such a day that the maven plugin supports the full package name.

  archivesBaseName = "android_extras_gingerbread"
