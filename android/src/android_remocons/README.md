Rocon Android
=============

Remoticons for pairing and concert modes as well as some simple apps for testing.

Java Package Names
==================

Endeavour to put all your package names under com.github.rocon.android.xxx. It's not a strict fit, but robotics-in-concert fails anyway because of the dashes. 

For apps, add a further namespace (i.e. com.github.com.rocon.android.apps.xxx).
