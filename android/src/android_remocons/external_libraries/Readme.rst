External Jars
=============

What libraries we have here are usually patched libraries for android. You can't find them
in maven central (e.g. vanilla snake_yaml is on maven central, doesn't run on android because
it uses introspection methods that the dalvik virtual machine does not support).

It would be great to get these out to a maven repository of our own.
